X: {short, middle, tall}
Y: {basketball, football, gymnastics}
//as long as number of options is small, we can compute everything we need
if X is not one dimensional value, P(X) gets get really hard to calculate
	naive bayes assumption
	X1 = {x11, x12,...}
	X2 = {...}
	Y -target
	
	we want
		max y P(Y|X1,X2..)= max y P(X1|Y)*P(X2|Y)...*P(Y) ----to rab≈°
				--why weight with P(Y) 
	
	
P(X,Y) = P(X|Y)*P(Y)=P(Y|X) * P(X)

P(Y|X)//what is the propability of sport if i know the height
P(Y|X) = (P(X|Y)*P(Y))/P(X)
