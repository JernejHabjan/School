Will provide the code on the day of arrival. Best neighborhood in Nashville.  Close to everything local and touristy. 2 blocks from music row, edgehill, demumbruen or the gulch.  Less than a mile to the Bridegestone arena. Free Green Line bus 2 blocks away.  Chevy Camaro Convertible rental available.  5 dollar Uber to downtown.  Short walk to multiple neighborhoods.

Over a hundred years later in 2013, Jack restored a corner of this 10-acre stretch and opened his third restaurant, Jack’s Bar-B-Que – now a Nashville landmark.

One of Nashville's two last-standing carriage homes, our Carriage House originally served as the stables, paddock, tack room and servants' quarters for George Henry Ratterman (owner of the “big house"" out front). If you use your imagination, you can still see where carriages would enter!  The former tack room sat on the lower right side of the property, and the stable was on the left. Upstairs, where this apartment is located, housed the servants. The property was condemned and scheduled for demolition by the city in 1979 before it was purchased and restored by the current property owner.

A few things about the Unit: This is a 1900sq 2 LEVEL loft downtown Nashville. The building is mostly young professionals. This unit has a hotel like feel. Every two weeks, and after a guest leaves, this condo is cleaned by a professional cleaning service (very important to me especially after visiting other Airbnb's) haha. The balcony, that over looks the pool and city view, is where you will probably want to hang out most of the time. There are 2 full couches that can also be used as beds. Also, a queen air mattress is provided for extra bedding. You will have access to everything the condo has to offer which includes a full kitchen with all stainless steel appliances, Washer and Dryer, Comcast, including all movie channels on a beautiful 70 inch 4K flat screen in the master bed room.

Everyone loves this charming, breezy, hotel-style apartment. It's actually part of my house – it’s the master bed/bath suite. It’s cut off from the main part of the house by a wall and has its own entrance. The interior connecting door remains locked, and our paths don’t cross inside the home. So we don't see each other.  But sounds do spill over. Mainly one way: from my side into yours. You may hear my TV or radio faintly, or kitchen noises, as my kitchen is the room on the other side of your wall.  However, I never hear the guests, because it's your hallway that backs up to our kitchen - so unless you stand in the hallway and talk loudly, I simply can't hear you. I also have white noise machines on both sides. The wall has been soundproofed, but 100% wasn't possible.

This home has a garage apartment at the back which is occasionally home to either us or other Airbnb guests. Probably, you'll never know they're there and they'll never know you're there. But if you happen to glance out a window and see a car at the back, don't worry, they probably belong there. You'll have access to the entire main house. The garages and basement are not a part of the deal. You'll park out front and you'll love it! We're typically nearby, within a few blocks. Sometimes, we occupy the garage apartment in the back.

People are also welcome to sleep on the couch in the living room. Another fun happening: like all of Nashville, our neighborhood is being built up, so there is construction happening constantly.
