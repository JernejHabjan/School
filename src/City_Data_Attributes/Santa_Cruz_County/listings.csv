Located on a seldom used alley 2 blocks from the beach, harbor, and restaurants.  The Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk is a walk of about 1 1/2 miles or 2 miles driving.  No smoking on this property. Inside or outside. Please don't risk your security deposit by smoking. Come discover why Santa Cruz is such a popular destination. Our stand alone cottage (not in our back yard) is on a quiet alley way centrally located near great activities.  Easy walking to the yacht harbor and beach so you can rent kayaks, surf boards, SUPs (stand up paddling).  Bicycling along the ocean is fairly flat or go to the mountains for a challenging mountain bike ride.  Or course one of the best beaches for sun bathing and volleyball is an easy two block walk right behind the ever popular Crow’s Nest Restaurant.

Ideal for that romantic weekend.    The two person slipper style copper tub is, by far, the main draw for many guests.  But the Cottage has a long history.  Initially it was the kiln for a potter who lived here before us.  That consisted of a concrete pad and open roof and walls.  When I needed an office, my husband made it into what became known as ""The Temple.""  He used recycled materials, including stained glass from his boyhood home in Missouri, made into windows by our son.  Later, it became Sarai's spa (Sudzzz) and that is when my husband built the fence and Sarai put in the private brick courtyard.   Soquel is a lovely little town about 6 miles from Santa Cruz.  From here, you can easily go hiking, go to the beach, visit wineries or just hang out.
