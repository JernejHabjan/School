I have been pleasantly surprised by how wonderful and courteous nearly all of my guests have been. I don't live at this house, but live a few blocks away. Guests are always welcome to come hang at my place and I am at the house all the time doing yard work and cleaning and stuff :) I'm pretty open in general and love meeting new people so it sort of depends on the level of interaction that the guests are looking for! There will most likely be other guests visiting at the same time so it also depends on them :) The light rail is about one block from the house and is a great way to get around!",0.0,2015-06-06,1,0.8977,0.10101010101010101,1,0.00101010101010101,1.0,0.8903508771929824,0.12,4.8,0,0,39.73509122038387,https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/6623752,-105.03671501699104,1125,1,Daybed in the living room,0.0,0.0,0.035,18.0,House,0.9,0.9,0.9,0.9,0.9,0.93,0.9,2.99,Shared room,-1,0.9403,,0.6597,0.3595,https://a1.muscache.com/im/pictures/95314924/7937ddb9_original.jpg?aki_policy=large,https://a1.muscache.com/im/pictures/95314924/7937ddb9_original.jpg?aki_policy=small,0.9884,4.505480731531428,"{'2015-06-06': 4.690033902007066, '2015-08-07': 4.698934915321497, '2015-10-02': 4.233774552852457, '2015-12-03': 4.299268428598157, '2016-05-14': 4.60539185873001}",0.5,4.615340237113104

We've listed the space for a steal so hurry before it's gone!  We will be coming back on Sunday 10/25 so please just let me know what time you plan to leave that day. We are flexible! The 15 bus on Colfax makes east/west travel convenient. You can catch the light rail from Auraria campus which is approximately a 20 minute walk or the 15 bus will take you closer. Uber and Lyft are personal car services that work much like taxis but with a similar Airbnb twist. Plus we are so close to everything, you can walk there!

Hi! My place is  the entire first floor of an old house, built back when Denver was a small little city and you could get to where you were going to easily by foot. Know what? You still can! You can walk anywhere you need to from here. It's a 15 minute walk from downtown -- or 5 minutes, if you catch the #10 bus a block away (it comes every 15 minutes). Parking around here isn't ideal, sure, but you'll love the peace and quiet and of having this 1,000 square foot condo all to yourself (this place is BIG for places in the neighborhood). There's a neighbor in the coachhouse in the back (quiet, friendly), and a neighbor upstairs (quiet, Irish). You'll have full access to my meager record collection, decent CD collection, and awesome kitchen. There's laundry in the place! It's free! A washer *and* a dryer! If you get scared of modern clothes-drying appliances I have a clothes rack for you to use instead!
