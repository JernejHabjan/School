When we bought the property, we envisioned turning it into a carriage house. We hired DesignPlatform through friends to work on the remodel. As you'll see, they did an incredible job! We share a large backyard (between our house and the carriage house) which guests can enjoy, which includes a gas grill, patio, chairs, table. We'd love to say hi and answer any questions you have! Sunnyside has a lot of older homes (1900s) which makes for a lovely walk around the neighborhood! We're close to everything and Sunnyside (along with other north denver neighborhoods) is a hotspot right now!
