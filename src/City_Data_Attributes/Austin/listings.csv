Hi, this ad is for one room in my three bedroom bungalow. The house is situated in the quiet Hyde Park neighborhood, and offers a comfy, laid-back vibe. We are walking distance to mass transit, a number of restaurants and coffee shops. Biking means you have a huge array of options available, as we are 3 miles from downtown Austin. Currently, two bedrooms are available, while I stay in the back bedroom, which is not connected to the house. Because of this guests have told me they feel as if they have had the house to themselves. You have access to basically the entire house, including a living room with kitchen table and common area, kitchen, bathroom, front and back porches.

The house is relatively new construction in an older, more established neighborhood.  The entire upstairs of this large house was recently converted to its own unit with separate entrance via spiral staircase.  It is located on a quiet street 1.5 miles from Downtown.  It is even closer to Rainey Street and East Sixth Street's bars/restaurants/food trucks.  Lady Bird Lake and the 10 mile Hike and Bike trail that surrounds it is only two blocks away. Regarding transportation, there is plenty of free (non-metered) street parking.  There are several bus lines within a few blocks.  And there are frequently Cars2Go parked nearby waiting to be used. This is an excellent location from which to enjoy Austin.  But this is not a good location for loud parties.  It is in a residential neighborhood and any noise heard from outside the house (eg loud music) is disruptive to neighbors. The rental is upstairs. I'm happy to answer questions about things to do.

My house is a short drive to downtown (15 min) and right on major thoroughfares.  I am also walking distance from two major bus lines.  Please see the maps I've posted to get an idea of location and distance to downtown (about 20 minutes to Zilker Park / Auditorium Shores / downtown by bus).  The bus is $1 for one way, $2 for a day, $9 for a week pass.  A cab ride to/from downtown is about $20.  Another option is Car2To, which has a $35 membership fee, then it is .35 a minute after, or about $7 to/from downtown.  If you have your own wheels, you have a parking spot in my driveway, on the left hand side.

I have a lovely private guest room to share - if you need a place to stay for the night or for a week - I'm happy to host you! Let me  know how I can help! It's true - I do have 3 cats but I promise you'll hardly see them. They are true scaredy cats and will hide from strangers but they are getting braver and might come sniff you out if you sit down long enough. If you don't want them near you it's not hard to shoo them away :)        I do not allow them to go into the guest room and would appreciate you doing your best to keep them out as well, they tend to ruin things like chewing on the blinds if they are in the way of them sitting on the window sill :P This also keeps the cat hair out of that room and makes cleaning a lot easier. So if you truly do love cats and want to play with them you'll have to do so out in the living room or kitchen area.

Built in 1951, this home is one of the first by Austin architect AD Stenger, who began building Mid Century Modern homes in Austin 3 years before MCM legend Joseph Eichert in California. The east-facing skylight windows & southern-facing window wall in the bedroom create a beautiful and natural view to wake up to. Just outside the window is a lovely and large backyard with seating for morning coffee & meditation, or a nice evening drink with friends.  AD Stenger was a fan of Frank Lloyd Wright and sought to create spaces that connected the outside space to the inside space, so the home feels natural and remote, even in the middle of the city.

This 5BR/2.5BA house is no exception to that trend. The first floor structure was built in the early 20’s and has plenty of the original character. In stages since then, three additional floors have been added in the form of a tower. The beauty of this unique home is clear both inside and out. The first level has two traditional bedrooms, one with a king and one with a queen, and an additional sleeping space in the living room that is defined by a curtain partition. The first floor is also home to a fully stocked kitchen and two bathrooms -- one attached to the master and one in the hallway between the two rooms. The multi-use space in the living area can be either an extended living room or a sleeping room with two twin beds that can roll into a king if you prefer. The three-story tower addition has a separate use for each floor. The first is home to a twin bed, working desk, and sitting area.
