Great for going on walks during morning, lunch, or evening. Could potentially work from home in room with privacy. None-no outsiders Would prefer for no guests unless I am home to meet them. Thanks, hope you understand. It's great, very bike and walker friendly. Central location and in the middle of all the great local restaurants with wonderful food!

PERFECT for those in town for Business or travel. The apartment is just off North Lamar Boulevard, where the 1M Bus takes you straight downtown for just $1 each way. Or 5 minute drive (10 with  traffic). It is walking distance to a 7 Eleven, KFC, Whataburger, Thai restaurant, Dan's Hamburgers, and is right next to a McDonalds! Or for the health conscious there is a Whole Foods on the North Lamar Blvd closer to downtown and plenty of grocery stores close by and some very trendy restaurants on Burnet Rd & North Loop both within walking distance.
