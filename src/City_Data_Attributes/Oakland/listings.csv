The haven is probably not the best match for those who prefer a minimalist environment. It's a old but charming apartment.  We don't keep a television on purpose. Wifi is fast enough if you want to stream movies. While at the haven you will have full use of the kitchen, living room, bathroom and 1 bedroom.
