Historic Shaw. My favorite two restaurants in the neighborhood are Thai x ing and Zenebech Injera which happen to be ethnic cuisine. Zenebech Injera is a very good budget Ethiopian food. The very good sample platter Mehaberawi is 14$ and very good! (You can Google Zenebech Injera since airbnb hides websites on all communications- 608 T St NW, Washington, DC 20001 ) Thai x ing is a little more expensive but I think it's the best Thai food in the city.

I have a very large master bedroom upstairs in our Georgetown townhouse, that is available to rent when I am out of town.  All utilities are included (including wireless internet).  The room is definitely large enough for two people, however I would prefer to have just one at a time.  This is a great option if you're in the process of looking for another apartment, or are just in DC temporarily. The bedroom is extremely large; it is basically two rooms combined.  Half of the room has a hardwood floor, and the other half has a new carpet.  The room features five large windows facing south and west, a new air-conditioning unit, two closets, a full-size (double) bed, a desk, chair, bookcase, bedside table, shelving unit, iPhone 4/iPod speakers/radio dock, and a mini-fridge.  Thanks to some connections with local DC artists, the room features some tasteful figurative art as well (not seen in the photos).  I can also provide sheets and towels if needed.

A wonderful tour is offered weekdays!! The Old Mansard Bishops house and Convent buildings next door still retain the architecture of the period, and are quite beautiful. It is a very short distance to the White House, just one block to 16th Street the 'Avenue of the Presidents', and a stroll to the downtown Business District and Major Monuments. And for those looking for DC'S newest and hottest restaurants and clubs, the Rectory is just a couple of blocks away to the must-go and trendy 14th Street corrid",0.0,2013-12-22,1,0.9084,0.10638297872340426,1,0.0010869565217391304,0.5,0.9283667621776505,0.3,4.8,0,1,38.91475720457988,https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/1576762,-77.03348298911507,1125,3,"Historic Mansion, Large & Imposing",0.0,0.0,0.01,-1,House,0.9,0.9,0.9,0.9,1.0,0.94,1.0,0.46,Entire home/apt,-1,0.7763,,-0.128,0.0,https://a1.muscache.com/ac/pictures/22937110/d40a50a3_original.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none&size=large_cover&output-format=jpg&output-quality=70,https://a1.muscache.com/ac/pictures/22937110/d40a50a3_original.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none&size=small&output-format=jpg&output-quality=70,0.7763,4.997162324730628,"{'2013-12-22': 5.068678395450162, '2014-07-18': 5.086678245451411, '2014-12-15': 4.972179199610127, '2015-01-28': 5.05226186558791, '2015-08-02': 4.806013917654145}",-1.1,4.833293055891202

There are three furnished bedrooms (two queens and a full sized bed), a couch that doubles as a single bed, and a twin air mattress.  Let me address some other questions you might have:  Parking- I can provide you with a visitor pass that will let you park anywhere in my parking zone without having to worry about a ticket.  This, of course, includes right in front of my house on the street (assuming spots are available, and they usually are somewhere on my block).  We can also negotiate a price for garage parking behind the house.   Transportation- In my opinion, the best way to get around DC is to ditch the car and use DC's public transportation (the bus and light rail).  In 1 block you can walk to bus stops that take you to Eastern Market or through the U St Corridor and into the heart of Adams Morgan.
