The queen bed lies under a south facing window, letting in lots of light throughout the day. The apartment is on the first floor of a large 1910 home, which was converted to an eight-plex in the 1940s to adapt to the demands of WWII.

It's located in North Portland with easy parking! There are three rooms, and plenty of community space. If you'd like more details, just let me know! It's a 3 bedroom, 2.5 bathroom townhouse that you'll have all to yourself if you want it. The whole house will be yours.  I'll be gone and take my dog with me, so you can use every room. I can be there to greet you, or if you'd prefer you can just let yourself in.  Otherwise I won't be around.  If you need something, I'm just a phone call or short drive away. The house is in St. John's, a North Portland neighborhood.  It is about 15 minutes (driving) to downtown Portland, so you'll probably want your own transportation.  Parking is easy, and it's a quite place to stay while you enjoy other parts of the city. Bus 44 picks up right nearby and can take you to the light rail (short 15 minutes) or downtown (about 40 minutes).",10.0,2016-04-17,6,0.0,0.125,1,0.001,0.75,0.8781973203410475,0.02,3.6,0,1,45.596625014461985,https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/12207448,-122.76031579160161,10,3,North Portland Townhouse,0.7693,0.0,0.005,100.0,House,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.8,0.92,1.0,1.90,Entire home/apt,-1,0.0772,,0.7412,0.0,https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/4b9bef76-632f-4603-94b2-41fb43ac7464.jpg?aki_policy=large,https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/4b9bef76-632f-4603-94b2-41fb43ac7464.jpg?aki_policy=small,0.9357,2.0910490083884268,"{'2016-04-17': 2.7372353315599405, '2016-05-08': 2.4272525528254283, '2016-05-15': 2.6161309484701083, '2016-06-17': 2.6739055165496635, '2016-06-24': 0.0007206934842819883}",-1.9,0.0
