Everything in our home we have either made or collected from our extensive travels or from fellow artists. It is bright, clean, eclectic, and filled with love. Gentle guests only - no parties or unauthorized guests allowed. Our guests will have access to the entire house - 2 bedrooms, kitchen, bathroom, living area, front and back porch, and backyard. We will likely greet you when you arrive. We love visitors and are happy to tell you all of our bad jokes. We are both self employed artists and work long hours, but available if you need anything.
