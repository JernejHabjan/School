I live in a true Chicago neighborhood - it's called ""the bungalow district"".  Starbucks is an 8 block walk as is Walgreen's, several eating establishments, and a Chase bank. I'm close, by bus, to (3) stops along the Blue Line (L) train.  There are always tons of UberX's nearby as there are taxi's.  It's quiet, family oriented, and close to both 90 and 94. Street parking is available about 1 block away for free and lots of it!",0.0,2015-07-12,1,0.0,0.10638297872340426,1,0.001,0.5,0.9380421313506815,0.01,4.8,0,1,41.96240798236856,https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/7246471,-87.7308053958588,1125,1,Adorable bedroom in modern home!,-0.0258,0.1759,0.009,65.0,House,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.21,Private room,-1,0.0,,0.886,-0.1531,https://a2.muscache.com/ac/pictures/91907534/048ae307_original.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none&size=large_cover&output-format=jpg&output-quality=70,https://a2.muscache.com/ac/pictures/91907534/048ae307_original.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none&size=small&output-format=jpg&output-quality=70,0.8927,3.1030601299975014,"{'2015-07-12': 2.8569110175601438, '2015-07-24': 3.198250607183424, '2015-08-12': 3.2622878372366895, '2015-08-24': 3.1849816315867976, '2015-09-22': 2.9226789835607976}",-0.4,2.8845599123093786
