You are in a beautiful and quiet victorian neighborhood, but you are also steps away from the action of the Back Bay, the restaurants of the South End, the Green line at the Prudential Center, Copley Square, Symphony Hall, the Museum of Fine Arts, Fenway Park and so many other attractions. The Green Line and Orange Line are both just a few blocks away. If you have a car rates are approximately $35 daily in a lot just a couple blocks away.

The unit has comfortable sofa seating for two as well as a dining table with seating for three people. Most of our units are designed to be interchangeable and each unit has at least one “like-kind” unit within the same building that is similar in size and identical in amenities as well as sleeping capacity. In most cases the unit you have reserved is the unit you will be staying in, however, we reserve the right to put you in a like-kind unit for the term of your rental. If you are given a like-kind unit it is guaranteed to be in the same building and no more than one floor above the unit you have reserved (this only applies to buildings without elevators). If your unit is going to be changed to a like-kind unit you will be notified at least 24 hours in advance. Guests have access to their unit and the common laundry facilities in the building.
