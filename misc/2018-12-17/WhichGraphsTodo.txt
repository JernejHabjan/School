1. Does learning even work?
    Evaluation vs greedy and random

        (x - num actions executed, y - score)

2. Pitting action comparison (5 eps, 20 eps) - same example can be used for one-hot vs numeric encoders (3.)

    (or some other type of plots)

4. Learning through iterations:
    How many of which actions are outputed at each training iteration/episode
    This type of visualization would be nice to have:

5. Directions of action executions for player 1 and -1 through learning iterations
    To see if directions for actions for some reason change when learning time is increased - maybe more attacking on opposite side, building buildings on this players side..
