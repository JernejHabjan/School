class GlObject{
private:
    idEnum ObjId;
    //other identifiers
public:
    void move_obj(); //the movements are the same for all the objects (nextpos = pos + vel)
    void rotate_obj(); //rotations are the same for every objects too
    virtual Polygon generate_mesh() = 0; // the polygons are different
}
and I have 4 different objects in my game: plane, obstacle, player, bullet and I designed them like this:

class Player : public GlObject{ 
private:
    std::string name;
public:
    Player();
    Bullet fire() const; //this method is unique to the class player
    void generate_mesh();
}
